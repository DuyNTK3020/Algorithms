/*
Description
Given a sequence of n integers a=a1, . . ., an. A subsequence of a consists of contiguous elements of a (for example, ai, ai+1, . . . ,aj). The weight of a subsequence is defined to be the sum of its elements. A subsequence is called even-subsequnce if its weight is even. Find the even-subsequence of a having largest weight.
Input

    Line 1: contains a positive integer n (1 <= n <= 106)
    Line 2: contains a1, . . ., an (-106 <= ai <= 106)

Output

    The weight of the largest even-subsequence found, or write NOT_FOUND if no solution found.

Example
Input
4
1  2  -3  4
Output
